I joined a startup as a full-time full-stack developer (listed as a Software Developer on documents) in January 2023. At that time, I was still in college, but it was the internship semester. Despite this, I was working full-time with a salary of 4.5 LPA, which was a huge amount for me. I moved to Chennai to do my full-time job. I also did a 9-month internship remotely while in college, starting in May 2022, at the same startup.

In staring of my full time i was enjoying staying late night and even worked on some of the holiday's as i was free i have nothing to do in Chennai at that time. 1st month passed and in 2nd month i started taking some ownership not all but some like reviewing & doing things when team lead is not available. It was great but after it i was given some other project also as i was doing great i was also appreciated by the company.

In starting 3rd month or 4th i stated to feel to lazy & become depressed and was unable to work properly i thing it was due to food & water. I was in Chennai so the food their does not suited my body, i did not have time to prepare my food as i was working their but also working late night & on weekend made my body unable to function. I was eating food outside daily so it could be the reason also once i did not slept whole 2 day just thinking about the things why am i even working here if i cannot keep my body healthy.

In 4 & 5 month i took some sick leave took some rest. Doctor suggested the problem was food & my digestive system is not in good condition. So I tried to cook my own food but it did not work out, i don't have great cooking skill. I was unable to do time management properly also. I started out my day at 8am-9am get ready and reach office by 10am then stay their till 7pm. It was not 7pm daily sometime i have to be thier more like till 8-9 or till next day. Also They did not consider overtime like if i did 12hr yesterday today i should do less work right no i have to complete 9hr. I started to slowly closing my work earlier so i can leave at 7. Also their was no pay for overtime if you do overtime or late night work no payment for that. I am person who need a good sleep to work properly which i was not getting also. My productive was also declining i was less focused my eyes are looking very tired.

In the end of 5th or 6th month i sent a resignation email after getting to much depressed & overwork. Also the money that i was earning in end of month it just feel nothing it just got spend of food & living their only 5 thousand i was able to save per month. After resignation i was working very less also timing out on correct time i was not looking to complete 8hr i was just looking to complete my thing while i was leaving. I took 2 month's break and rested fully at my home after that i started applying for job and got other job that i also left due to ethical reason. 

I know its like running away from things like you are not facing things. It was my first job in offline mode and i left it within 6 month i have seen my productivity decline and i know if i cannot provide value to  company then why should i be their. 

## Things i learned
- You are only who have to maintain your health
- Food & its quality , Sleep, Physical Activity are very important
- You can sometime say no to things like working on weekend & overtime if you are not paid
- You have to make decision other will not help you that much in the end
- Drink Water 
- Deadline & important thing will come every time in software industry but you have to maintain yourself
- Lot of tech & things i learned while working with this Startup
