  <p> I know I still have a lot to learn, but I am improving. I also understand that tech does not matter that much
	new tech will come & old tech will also stay so you have to make balance between them. In the end, developing innovative solutions and meeting user needs are what matter.
  </p>
  <p>By the way, I am a tech enthusiast, so experimenting and researching have become hobbies of mine</p>
  <p>
	If you have read this far, I want to let you know that I am currently becoming unemployed as my current project violates my work ethics. If anyone is interested
	mail at <a href="mailto:kuldeepdev@gmail.com">kuldeepdev407@gmail.com</a>. Also i am available for freelance work ðŸ™‚;
